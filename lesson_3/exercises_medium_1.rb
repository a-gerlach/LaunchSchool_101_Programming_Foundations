puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

Q4

shift(1) will shift elements 0 and 1
The output here will 1 nil nil nil, because after
the first number is printed, two numbers get shifted
and that means it will p nil. 



numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end

the output of the second example will be, 
1
2
because the first time the 4 is popped of
and the second time the three is popped of and the array is empty. 


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end

Q5




# The purpose of the number % dividend == 0 is that we onyl want to 
# have whole numbers. With the above method the number and the
# dividennd divided to with no "Rest" 

def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  begin if (number > 0 && dividend > 0) 
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end until dividend == 0
  divisors
end
end

p factors(0)
# p factors(6) # [1, 2, 3, 6]

# Erst fÃ¼llt man 6 in die Method. Dann wird 6 durch 6 geteilt, dass gibt
# 1 und das kommt in divident array.
# dann 6 / 5 ist nicht %divident == 0, deswegen nicht
# dann 6 / 4 auch nicht
# dann 6 / 3 ist 2 und kommt ins Array 
# dann 6 / 2 ist 3 und kommt ins array 
# dann 6 / 1 ist 1 unf kommt ins array. 
# Bonus 2 The pupose of this line is to return the divisor array.

Q8

In the first method we are pushing the elements into the array,
whch changes the buffer array permanently. This then allows us to call
the buffer later and get a good result

In the second method we also alter the buffer, but we we do not
  alter the input_array. Whatever is in the InputArray wil be added again
  and agin into the buffer, wchih might not be what we want.
